![Seamus the Jedi Knight](/img/cats/seamus_jedi.jpg){: .book} Hello, I'm Bart Lantz, I'm a programmer/geek living in Denvercityville, Colorado. I live here with my accordionist partner and our two cats. I ride bike everywhere. Colorado is great for that: you can commute by bike 11 months out of the year! I enjoy creating free open source software. I run Ubuntu Linux on my personal computers. I love thinkpad laptops, especially the keyboard and touchpad. My editors of choice are Emacs and Vim, yes, both! I love reading and occasionally writing: I've completed [National Novel Writing Month](http://nanowrimo.org) twice now.

This website is part blog, part grimoire of various computer incantations.

Here are some top 10 lists and, of course, a few cat pics.
