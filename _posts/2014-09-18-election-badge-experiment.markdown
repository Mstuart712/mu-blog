I've been experimenting with codepen a lot lately. There is something so cool about experimenting with some tricky javascript and sending a link to a code sandbox somewhere to someone and they fork it and say, "here's the fix".  Or they take the idea a step further and say, "and what about this?" 

Well, below is a ballot feature that I'd like to replicate with Drupal's webform module.  (well except for the tricksy voting feature.)
